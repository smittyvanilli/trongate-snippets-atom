# Smitty's Snippets for the Trongate framework - Atom Editor

## Read Me

### All developers

These snippets are to make life easier and faster then before using the Trongate framework. For sure, this will create a better experience and workflow.


The Trongate website is at [Trongate website](https://trongate.io).

The Trongate framework can be downloaded on Github at [Trongate framework](https://github.com/davidjconnelly/trongate-framework)


### Speed Coding Academy

As a founding member at Speed Coding Academy,
with Trongate, companion tools, and these snippets, there is no doubt you can create anything at lightning fast feeds!

Of course, recommendations are always appreciated inside the forum, if you would like some improvements. Folks at the academy, these are your passports to having lightning speed in the sky.

When you use these snippets with Sublime Text within HTML Files, or HTML within PHP, simply use the less than sign(<). As soon you start typing, it will display all the snippets. If it is directly within PHP itself, it should automatically show all of the Trongate Snippets as soon as you type.
